when kill program, doesn't clear current source line marker

gdb: doesn't show source line when hit first breakpoint

asm for function: if blank, fill in after program is stopped

accept connection or switch to gdb:  should stop listening on port
	need simple example to submit to ACE list
restart either xdebug or java:  unable to listen on port & crashes on exit
	also need to fix SetProgram()
gdb
	enable call to UnlockDisplays(), when JXGetAssertHandler is defined
		check every time symbols are loaded

for program with threads:
	set scheduler-locking on/off/step
	break <location> thread <gdb thread number>

CMBreakpointTable:
	pressing return while editing the last row should save the value
	problem is that setting breakpoint value takes time
		so can't restart editing immediately

java
	selected stack frame
		select source line
			get code offset <-> line number for method
			search for frame's code offset
		show local variables
			get list of method's variables (slot #'s)
			get frame's value for each slot #'s
	start JVM
		JVMDisplaySourceForMain
			get Methods for main-class
			find "main"
			get LineTable
			get first line number, scroll to that
	set breakpoint
		search code index <-> line index for location

	source-jar unzips to /tmp
		display stderr from zip in cmd line window
		delete /tmp directories when delete link or open different program

xdebug
	click stack trace: selection jumps back to last frame
	temp breakpoint doesn't disappear

	Enable XDSocket::StartTimer() when not debugging
	Always update stack, even if Stack Trace window is hidden
	Eliminate double call to get local vars
		Preserve existing items; don't just delete all before update
	request source from debugger instead of assuming that file:// exists
	*set* values
	support conditional breakpoints, etc.
